Messages JSON Schemas
=====================

This section contains the message schemas, describing what properties each
schema holds, its title, unit of measure and description. Some messages are
sent by DISCOS components that are common among all the three telescopes, other
messages are instead station-specific, and, although some of them can be
delivered on the same topics, they might differ from station to station.
